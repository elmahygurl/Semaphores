# Semaphores
## Project overview 
This C program implements a multi-threaded counter system using pthreads and semaphores.

The system consists of three types of threads: mMonitor, mCollector, and mCounter.

The mMonitor thread monitors the counts generated by mCounter threads at regular intervals and enqueues them into a buffer.

The mCollector thread dequeues values from the buffer and processes them.
