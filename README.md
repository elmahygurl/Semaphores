# Semaphores
### This C program implements a multi-threaded counter system using pthreads and semaphores. The system consists of three types of threads: mMonitor, mCollector, and mCounter. The mMonitor thread monitors the counts generated by mCounter threads at regular intervals and enqueues them into a buffer. The mCollector thread dequeues values from the buffer and processes them.
